Objective: To create a clean, modern, and trustworthy brand identity that appeals to a diverse audience of trading card collectors and players. Our visual and written communication should be professional, easy to understand, and consistent across all platforms.

1. Brand Identity & Logo
Logo: The logo is our primary brand identifier. It should be used consistently across the website, social media, and marketing materials.

Primary Logo: [Description of your main logo, e.g., a stylized card icon with the shop name.]

Secondary/Stacked Logo: [Description of an alternative layout for smaller spaces.]

Icon-Only Logo: [Description of the icon used without text, for favicons or social media profiles.]

Logo Usage:

Always maintain a clear space around the logo equal to at least half the height of the logo.

Never stretch, distort, or alter the logo's proportions.

Use the logo on a solid background that provides sufficient contrast.

2. Color Palette
Primary Colors: These are the dominant colors of the brand.

[Color Name]: [Hex Code, e.g., #001F3F] - [Usage: Main background color, dark text.]

[Color Name]: [Hex Code, e.g., #FFFFFF] - [Usage: Text on dark backgrounds, key content areas.]

Secondary/Accent Colors: Used for highlighting important elements and calls to action.

[Color Name]: [Hex Code, e.g., #FF4136] - [Usage: Call-to-action (CTA) buttons like "Add to Cart," "Buy Now."]

[Color Name]: [Hex Code, e.g., #2ECC40] - [Usage: Success messages, "In Stock" indicators.]

Neutral Colors: Used for supporting text, borders, and backgrounds.

[Color Name]: [Hex Code, e.g., #EFEFEF] - [Usage: Light background for sections, card borders.]

[Color Name]: [Hex Code, e.g., #808080] - [Usage: Subheadings, inactive text, borders.]

Usage Rules:

Use the accent color only for key interactive elements to maintain its effectiveness.

Maintain a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text to background color to ensure readability, especially for body text.

3. Typography
Font Family: Use a clean, sans-serif font family. Sans-serif fonts are highly legible on screen and convey a modern, clean aesthetic.

Primary Font (Headings): [Font Name, e.g., Lato, Montserrat, Poppins]

Secondary Font (Body Text): [Font Name, e.g., Lato, Roboto, Open Sans]

Font Hierarchy & Sizing:

H1 (Page Title): [Font Size, e.g., 36px] - Bold. Used for main page titles (e.g., "Magic: The Gathering Cards").

H2 (Section Heading): [Font Size, e.g., 28px] - Semi-Bold. Used for major sections on a page (e.g., "Featured Cards," "New Arrivals").

H3 (Sub-Heading): [Font Size, e.g., 20px] - Medium. Used for sub-sections or product names on a list.

Body Text: [Font Size, e.g., 16px] - Regular. Used for all general text and descriptions.

Small Text: [Font Size, e.g., 14px] - Regular. Used for fine print, captions, or helper text.

Usage Rules:

Maintain a consistent line height of at least 1.5 times the font size for readability.

Avoid using more than two font families to prevent a cluttered appearance.

4. Imagery & Iconography
Product Photography:

All product images (cards, sleeves, deck boxes) must be high-resolution and well-lit.

Card images should be a clear, front-on shot, with minimal background distractions.

For card condition images, provide consistent lighting and angle for each shot.

Illustrations & Icons:

Style: Use a simple, clean, and minimalist style for all icons. Avoid skeuomorphism or overly detailed illustrations.

Iconography: Use a consistent set of icons for functions like "Add to Cart," "Search," "Filter," and navigation.

File Format: Use SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) for icons where possible to ensure they are crisp at any size.

5. UI Components & Elements
Buttons:

Primary CTA Button: [Accent Color] with white text. Rounded corners are preferred.

Secondary Button: [Neutral Color] with dark text. Used for less critical actions (e.g., "View Details").

Disabled Button: A lighter shade of the button color, with a clear indication that it is non-interactive.

Forms:

Input Fields: A light gray background with a thin border. On focus, the border should change to a subtle accent color.

Error Messages: Displayed clearly in a contrasting color (e.g., red) below the input field.

Cards (UI Element):

Use cards with subtle drop shadows or a light border to separate them from the background.

Ensure each card element (image, name, price) is clearly laid out and easy to read.

6. Tone of Voice
Persona: Our brand is knowledgeable, professional, and friendly. We are an authority on trading cards, but we speak in a way that is accessible to everyone, from a seasoned veteran to a new player.

Language:

Use clear, simple, and direct language. Avoid jargon unless it's a common term within the TCG community.

Be helpful and encouraging.

The tone should be confident but not arrogant.

Examples:

Correct: "Add to Cart," "Filter by Rarity," "Find Your Next Deck."

Incorrect: "Slam That Card in the Cart," "Tweak Your Search," "Get Your Deck on."

7. Accessibility
Color Contrast: All text and UI elements must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards for color contrast.

Alt Text: All images must have descriptive alt text for screen readers.

Keyboard Navigation: The entire site should be fully navigable using only a keyboard.

Readability: Use a minimum font size of 16px for body text and ensure sufficient line height and letter spacing.
